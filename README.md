# KeyText

### Problem ###
With hundreds of thousands of articles, research papers, and encyclopedia pages
being published each day; it becomes more and more difficult for researchers, 
journalists, and the everyday reader to stay caught up. The difficulty in
digesting content affects efficiency in all fields of life from jobs, teaching,
research, to even reading the news. 

### Solution ###
KeyText alleviates these problems by providing multiple functions that
all help to parse out information from content. It allows for multiple functions
that span from webcrawling for important links and documents to processing those
documents for key information. KeyText allows the capturing of important
key words and the creation of summarized text through utilizing language and text
processing algorithms/techniques.
